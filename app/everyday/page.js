            How are you? I’m fine. I’m at home, of course, because of lockdown. I started my engineering course at Manchester University last year, but I’m not there now. I went to Manchester in October and I stayed in the student accommodation. We had lectures in the lecture rooms for three weeks, but after that, we had to stay in our accommodation because of Covid-19. I studied by computer. I wanted to go out to bars and join a basketball team, but I couldn’t. Luckily, there were some cool students in my accommodation. I made some good friends and we had cool parties.

But now I’m at home. I’m still studying by computer. I have four hours of lectures every day and then I work on projects. Actually, it’s quite good. We can do a lot of things by computer. I use different software programmes, read articles, and have discussions with the other students. I enjoy those discussions because I’m alone most of the time. Dad and mum are both at work all day. I can’t leave my town or visit friends, so I work! I work much harder than I did at school!

I miss playing basketball, but I’m keeping active. I go jogging once a day. But I’m watching a lot of videos too.
